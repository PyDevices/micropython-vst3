"""Scaling functions for every MIDI 1.0 Control Change code.

Source: "Table 3 - Control Change Messages and RPNs", MIDI Manufacturers
Association, 2020. Which control each code means comes from the spec;
nothing here is invented to suit a particular instrument.


Why these do not return 7-bit numbers
-------------------------------------
The spec lists every controller's range as 0-127 because MIDI is a wire
protocol and 7 bits is what fits in a data byte. That is a property of the
cable, not of the control. VST3 has no such limit: it normalises every
parameter to a 0.0-1.0 float, and that is what the host sends us, what an
automation lane records, and what the plug-in hands a macro.

So the translation between the two is ours to choose, and we choose not to
quantise:

  Resolution. Rounding a host's float to one of 128 steps would discard
  resolution we were handed for free. A slow filter sweep quantised to 128
  steps is audible as stair-stepping, and automation envelopes are exactly
  where this library spends its time. Continuous controls therefore keep
  full float precision end to end.

  Centre. MIDI's centre detent is byte 64, which normalises to 64/127 =
  0.50394, not 0.5. In VST3 the natural centre is exactly 0.5 - it is
  where a host parks an untouched parameter and what a bipolar control's
  default wants to be. A bipolar control here is therefore exactly neutral
  at 0.5, not at 0.50394. Switches flip at 0.5 for the same reason, rather
  than at the spec's byte-64 threshold.

The exception is controls whose value is a *number* rather than a
magnitude: bank and program numbers, parameter numbers, the note number in
Portamento Control, a channel count, and every LSB. Those genuinely are
7-bit integers - there is no such thing as bank 3.7 - so they are returned
as int, quantised on purpose.


How to use this in an instrument
--------------------------------
Two stages, and the second one is yours. This module only converts the
host's 0.0-1.0 into the control's own terms; turning that into something
synthio accepts is the instrument's job, because only the instrument knows
what its filter or envelope wants.

    from midi_cc import cc_scale, BRIGHTNESS, CHANNEL_VOLUME

    # Bind the scaler once, at import, named for the knob it drives.
    brightness = cc_scale[BRIGHTNESS]
    channel_volume = cc_scale[CHANNEL_VOLUME]

    def handle_event(event_type, channel, note_id, data0, value0, ...):
        if event_type == vstaudio.EVENT_PARAMETER:
            if data0 == 1:
                # brightness() gives -1..+1; map it onto the cutoff range
                # this instrument actually wants, in Hz.
                cutoff = 2000.0 * (4.0 ** brightness(value0))
            elif data0 == 0:
                volume = channel_volume(value0)      # already 0..1

Assigning a CC code to a knob is a decision the instrument author makes.
Nothing here forces a mapping - pick the code whose meaning matches the
knob, then map its result to whatever synthio needs.


Return types
------------
    float 0.0..1.0   continuous controllers the spec gives no unit to
    float -1.0..1.0  bipolar controllers, exactly 0.0 at 0.5
    int   0..127     values that really are 7-bit numbers (see above)
    bool              switches; the spec's <= 63 off / >= 64 on, at 0.5
    None              messages the spec says carry no value

Codes the spec marks "Undefined" are present as plain pass-throughs.
Undefined means free for manufacturer use, not unusable.

Why Sound Controllers 71-78 are bipolar
---------------------------------------
The MMA table gives these a flat 0-127 range and defers their defaults to
MMA RP-021, which is not much to build on. So this was checked against
shipping hardware instead. Roland's INTEGRA-7 MIDI implementation (2012)
documents all eight identically:

    Cutoff (Controller number 74)
    vv = Cutoff value (relative change): 00H - 40H - 7FH (-64 - 0 - +63)
    * The Cutoff Offset parameter (PART VIEW:OFFSET) will change.

Every one of 71-78 says "relative change", spans -64 to +63 about a centre
of 40H, and drives a parameter the machine itself calls an Offset. They
modify the patch's own value rather than replacing it. That is why they
are bipolar here, and it is what makes 0.5 a safe arrival value for a
macro nobody set: the patch is heard exactly as designed.

The same document confirms the rest of this table by contrast, which is
the more useful result:

    CC 91/93 Reverb and Chorus Send Level    "00H - 7FH (0 - 127)"
    CC 80-83 General Purpose 5-8             "00H - 7FH (0 - 127)"

Those are plain absolute levels, not relative - so the effect depths at
91-95 stay unipolar, where zero means none. CC 84 is "kk = source note
number", confirming it as an int rather than a magnitude, and CC 64-69 are
"0-63 = OFF, 64-127 = ON", confirming the switches.

CC 70 (Sound Variation) and CC 79 (undefined) are absolute. They sit in
the 70-79 block but no device found documents them as relative changes,
and the spec gives 79 no meaning at all.

One deviation worth recording: RPN Channel Fine Tuning is +/-100 cents
here, per the MMA table's own "00H 00H = -100 cents ... 7FH 7FH = +100
cents". The INTEGRA-7 accepts only 20 00H - 60 00H, i.e. +/-50 cents. That
is a device restricting the range, not disagreeing about it, so the
general definition is what this module implements.
